# if the name has even number of characters, print the two middle characters

# if the name has odd number of characters, print the middle character

# if the name has only one character, print the character

# A 2-D Heatmap is a data visualization tool that helps to represent the magnitude of the matrix in form of a colored table. In Python, we can plot 2-D Heatmaps using the Matplotlib and Seaborn packages. There are different methods to plot 2-D Heatmaps, some of which are discussed below.

# Use Cases For Heatmaps
# As we know the Heatmap is just a colored representation of a matrix. However, heatmap has a very large use case. We can use heatmaps for the following purpose.

#  It is used to see the correlation between columns of a dataset where we can use a darker color for columns having a high correlation.
#  We can also use heatmaps for plotting various time series and finance-related data where the Y-axis will be the month and X-axis will be the year and the element of the heatmap will be our data.


# Create a 12Ã—12 Heatmap with Random data using Matplotlib
# Program to plot 2-D Heat map
# using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow() method
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.random.random((12, 12))
plt.imshow(data)

plt.title("2-D Heat Map")
plt.show()


# Choosing Different Colormaps in Heatmap Using Matplotlib

# Program to plot 2-D Heat map
# using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow() method
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.random.random((12, 12))
plt.imshow(data, cmap="autumn")

plt.title("Heatmap with different color")
plt.show()


# The imshow function in matplotlib.pyplot is used to display data as an image, i.e., on a 2D regular raster. It is particularly useful for visualizing matrices or 2D arrays.

# interpolation Parameter
# The interpolation parameter in the imshow function determines how the image is resampled. This is important when the displayed image has a different resolution than the data. Different interpolation methods can affect the appearance of the image, especially when zooming in or out.


data = np.random.random((12, 12))
plt.imshow(data, cmap="autumn", interpolation="nearest")

# Add colorbar
plt.colorbar()

plt.title("Heatmap with color bar")
plt.show()
