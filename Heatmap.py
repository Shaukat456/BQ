# The imshow() function is used to display an image in a 2D array. It takes the following arguments:

# data: The 2D array to be displayed as an image.


# cmap: The color map to be used for the image. The 'hot' color map is used in this example.


# interpolation: The interpolation method to be used when displaying the image. The 'nearest' interpolation method is used in this example.


# The show() function is used to display the image on the screen.


# The output of this code is a heatmap displayed on the screen. The heatmap is generated using random data and the 'hot' color map. The output is as follows:
