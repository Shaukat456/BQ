## **🧩 Divide and Conquer Algorithm – Explained Simply**

# ### **📌 What is Divide and Conquer?**
# Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving approach where a problem is:
# 1. **Divided** into smaller subproblems.
# 2. **Solved** recursively.
# 3. **Combined** to get the final result.

# Think of it like **breaking a big problem into smaller, easier ones** and then solving them individually.

# ### **🍕 Real-World Analogy: Cutting a Pizza**
# Imagine you have a **large pizza** 🍕 and want to **share it equally** among friends:
# 1. **Divide**: You **cut the pizza** into slices.
# 2. **Solve**: Each friend takes their slice and eats it.
# 3. **Combine**: Once everyone eats, the whole pizza is gone.

# This is how **Divide and Conquer** works:
# - Break the problem into smaller parts.
# - Solve them separately.
# - Merge the results for the final solution.

# ### **🔢 Example: Merge Sort (Using Divide & Conquer)**
# Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that **divides** the array, **sorts** the subarrays, and **merges** them back.


#### **💻 Python Code for Merge Sort**
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr  # Base case: A single element is already sorted

    # Step 1: Divide the array into two halves
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])

    # Step 2: Merge the sorted halves
    return merge(left_half, right_half)


def merge(left, right):
    sorted_array = []
    i = j = 0

    # Compare elements and merge in sorted order
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            sorted_array.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            sorted_array.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    # Add remaining elements (if any)
    sorted_array.extend(left[i:])
    sorted_array.extend(right[j:])

    return sorted_array


# Example usage
numbers = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]
sorted_numbers = merge_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_numbers)


### **🔄 Steps of Merge Sort on [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10]**
# 1. **Divide** → Break into smaller lists
#    `[38, 27, 43, 3]` and `[9, 82, 10]`
#    Further breaking: `[38, 27]`, `[43, 3]`, `[9, 82]`, `[10]`
# 2. **Solve** → Sort small parts
#    `[27, 38]`, `[3, 43]`, `[9, 82]`, `[10]`
# 3. **Combine** → Merge back in order
#    `[3, 27, 38, 43]`, `[9, 10, 82]` → `[3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]`

# ### **🛠️ Key Advantages of Divide & Conquer**
# ✅ **Efficient** – Breaks problems into manageable chunks
# ✅ **Recursion-based** – Uses function calls for simplicity
# ✅ **Parallel Processing** – Can be optimized for multiple processors


## **🔍 Binary Search – A Divide and Conquer Algorithm**

### **📌 What is Binary Search?**
# Binary Search is an efficient algorithm used to find an element in a **sorted list** by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

# ### **🍕 Real-World Analogy: Searching in a Phonebook**
# Imagine you are searching for a **friend’s name in a phonebook** 📖:
# 1. **Open the middle page** and check the name.
# 2. If the name is **before the middle**, search in the left half.
# 3. If the name is **after the middle**, search in the right half.
# 4. Repeat until you find the name or confirm it’s not there.

# This is exactly how **Binary Search** works! 🚀

# ---


### **💻 Python Code for Binary Search**
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Find the middle index

        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half

    return -1  # Target not found


# Example usage
names = ["Ali", "Ayesha", "Bilal", "Fatima", "Hamza", "Sara", "Zain"]
target_name = "Fatima"
index = binary_search(names, target_name)

print(f"{target_name} found at index {index}" if index != -1 else "Not found")


### **🔄 Steps of Binary Search on Names**
# Searching for `"Fatima"` in the list:
# `["Ali", "Ayesha", "Bilal", "Fatima", "Hamza", "Sara", "Zain"]`

# 1. **Step 1** → Middle element = `"Fatima"` ✅ Found!
# 2. **Done!** 🎯

# For `"Sara"`:
# 1. **Middle = "Fatima"** → `"Sara"` is after it → Search right half.
# 2. **New middle = "Hamza"** → `"Sara"` is after it → Search right half.
# 3. **Next middle = "Sara"** ✅ Found!

# ---

# ### **⏳ Time Complexity of Binary Search**
# - **Best case**: `O(1)` (Found in the first attempt)
# - **Worst case**: `O(log n)` (Cuts the search space in half each time)

# **Faster than Linear Search (`O(n)`)!** 🚀

## **⚡ Quick Sort – A Faster Sorting Algorithm**
# Quick Sort is another **Divide and Conquer** algorithm that works by:
# 1. **Picking a pivot** element.
# 2. **Dividing the list** into two parts (smaller and larger than pivot).
# 3. **Recursively sorting** both parts.

# ---

### **🍕 Real-World Analogy: Organizing Books on a Shelf**
# 1. **Pick a random book** as a reference (pivot).
# 2. **Move all smaller books** to the left and larger books to the right.
# 3. **Repeat for left and right sections** until the books are sorted.

# ---


### **💻 Python Code for Quick Sort**
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr  # Base case: A single element is already sorted

    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]  # Choose a pivot
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]  # Elements smaller than pivot
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Elements equal to pivot
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]  # Elements greater than pivot

    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)  # Combine sorted parts


# Example usage
names = ["Ali", "Zain", "Bilal", "Fatima", "Ayesha", "Hamza", "Sara"]
sorted_names = quick_sort(names)
print("Sorted names:", sorted_names)


### **🔄 Steps of Quick Sort on Names**
# Sorting `["Ali", "Zain", "Bilal", "Fatima", "Ayesha", "Hamza", "Sara"]`:
# 1. **Choose pivot** → `"Fatima"`
# 2. **Partition**
#    - Left: `["Ali", "Bilal", "Ayesha"]`
#    - Middle: `["Fatima"]`
#    - Right: `["Zain", "Hamza", "Sara"]`
# 3. **Recursively sort left and right**
# 4. **Combine sorted lists**

# ---

### **⏳ Time Complexity of Quick Sort**
# - **Best case:** `O(n log n)`
# - **Worst case:** `O(n²)` (if bad pivots are chosen)
# - **Average case:** `O(n log n)`

# **Faster than Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort!** 🚀

# ---

# ### **📌 Why Use Divide & Conquer?**
# ✅ **Binary Search** → Fast searching in sorted lists (`O(log n)`).
# ✅ **Quick Sort** → Efficient sorting (`O(n log n)`).
# ✅ **Merge Sort** → Stable sorting (`O(n log n)`).
